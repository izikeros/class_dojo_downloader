> This version has several features not present in the original version:
> - add group name to the downloaded files (useful for multiple children
> - ~create classdojo directory in the current directory if it does not exist~
> - use .env file for storing session cookies and "start" date (NOT_BEFORE) value
> - updated README extended on e.g. instructions on how to get session cookies

## Prerequisites
- create virtual environment with `requests` and `python-dotenv` packages. You can use `pdm` or just pure Python:

```sh
# create venv
python3 -m venv venv

# activate
source venv/bin/activate

# install dependencies
pip install requests python-dotenv
```

## Usage

1. Create the folder/directory "classdojo_output" in the same folder as this script
2. Copy the `.env_template` to `.env` and add your session cookie values. Check your session cookie by opening ClassDojo in the browser and copy the following cookies (See the section below "Reading Cookies" for more information on how to get the cookies.) :
   - `dojo_log_session_id`,
   - `dojo_login.sid`,
   - `dojo_home_login.sid`
3. You will also want to edit NOT_BEFORE to align to the beginning of the school year you want to download.
4. Run this script ( source venv/bin/activate ; python3 main.py ) and wait for it to finish.

### Troubleshooting

- Make sure you have a correct session cookies set in this script. 
- Make sure you can open the `FEED_URL` listed in this script from within your browser (assuming you can open ClassDojo website)

## How it works:
1. Fetch list of items in the timeline, if there are multiple pages, it will fetch for all pages.
2. Collect list of URLs for the attachment for each item
3. Download the files into local temporary directory, and also save the timeline activity as a json file.
4. **NOTE: The script presumes most attachments are photos. You will have to rename any video files (usually larger, won't preview correctly) as .mpg instead of .jpg**
